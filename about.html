<p class="intro">
Engineer by training (and still at heart), now studying law to better understand the systems that shape technology and society. 
An opinionated citizen of the world - at least about the parts I know enough to have an opinion on. My research interests include law, literature, history, technology, and policy, both individually and in combination.
At the risk of sounding cheesy, a line I read in a freshman-year philosophy class has guided me since: “<em>The unexamined life is not worth living</em>.”
